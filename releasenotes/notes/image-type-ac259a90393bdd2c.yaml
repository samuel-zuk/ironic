    Introduces a new explicit ``instance_info`` parameter ``image_type``,
    which can be used to distinguish between partition and whole disk images
    instead of a ``kernel``/``ramdisk`` pair.

    Adding ``kernel`` and ``ramdisk`` is no longer necessary for partition
    images if ``image_type`` is set to ``partition`` and local boot is used.

    The corresponding Image service property is called ``img_type``.
