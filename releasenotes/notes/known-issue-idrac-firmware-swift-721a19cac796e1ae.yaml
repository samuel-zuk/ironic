    When using iDRAC with Swift to stage firmware update files in Management
    interface ``firmware_update`` clean step of ``redfish`` or ``idrac``
    hardware type, the cleaning fails with error "An internal error occurred.
    Unable to complete the specified operation." in iDRAC job. Until this is
    fixed, use HTTP service to stage firmware files for iDRAC.
