    Fixes an issue where a conductor would attempt local takeover. In case of
    heartbeat failure due to resource starvation, the current conductor was
    detected as offline when querying the database. In this scenario the
    conductor would forcibly remove reservations of it's own and initiate
    takeover. Current conductor is now excluded from the list of offline
    conductors, so that local takeover does not occur for this case. A warning
    is logged to highlight the potential resource starvation issue.
