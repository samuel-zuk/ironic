    Fixes ``idrac-wsman`` management interface ``set_boot_device`` method that
    would fail deployment when there are existing jobs present with
    the error::

      "Failed to change power state to ''power on'' by ''rebooting''.
      Error: DRAC operation failed. Reason: Unfinished config jobs
      found: <list of existing jobs>. Make sure they are completed
      before retrying."

    Now there can be non-BIOS jobs present during deployment.
    This will still fail for cases when there are BIOS jobs present.
    In such cases it's advised to use the ``idrac-redfish`` interface
    that does not have this limitation when setting boot device.
