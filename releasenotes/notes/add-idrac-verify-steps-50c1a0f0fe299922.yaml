    Adds support for running ``management.clear_job_queue``,
    ``management.reset_idrac`` and ``management.known_good_state`` methods as
    verify steps on iDRAC hardware type, for both ``idrac-wsman`` and
    ``idrac-redfish`` interfaces. In order to use this feature,
    ``[conductor]verify_step_priority_override`` needs to be used to set
    non-zero step priorities for the desired verify steps.
