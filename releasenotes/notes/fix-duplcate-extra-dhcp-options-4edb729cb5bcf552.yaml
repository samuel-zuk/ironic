    Fixed an issue where duplicate extra DHCP options was passed in the port
    update request to the Networking service. The duplicate DHCP options
    caused an error in the Networking service and node provisioning would
    fail. See bug:
    `2009774 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009774>`_.
