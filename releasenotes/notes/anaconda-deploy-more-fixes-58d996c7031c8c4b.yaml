fixes:

    Fixes the logic for the anaconda deploy interface. If the
    ironic node's instance_info doesn't have both 'stage2' and
    'ks_template' specified, we weren't using the instance_info
    at all. This has been fixed to use the instance_info if it
    was specified. Otherwise, 'stage2' is taken from the
    image's properties (assumed that it is set there).
    'ks_template' value is from the image properties if specified
    there (since it is optional); else we use the config setting
    '[anaconda] default_ks_template'.
  - |
    For the anaconda deploy interface, the 'stage2' directory was
    incorrectly being created using the full path of the stage2 file;
    this has been fixed.
  - |
    The anaconda deploy interface expects the node's instance_info
    to be populated with the 'image_url'; this is now populated
    (via PXEAnacondaDeploy's prepare() method).
  - |
    For the anaconda deploy interface, when the deploy was finished
    and the bm node was being rebooted, the node's provision state was
    incorrectly being set to 'active' -- the provisioning state-machine
    mechanism now handles that.
  - |
    For the anaconda deploy interface, the code that was doing the
    validation of the kickstart file was incorrect and resulted in
    errors; this has been addressed.
  - |
    For the anaconda deploy interface, the '%traceback' section in the
    packaged 'ks.cfg.template' file is deprecated and fails validation,
    so it has been removed.
