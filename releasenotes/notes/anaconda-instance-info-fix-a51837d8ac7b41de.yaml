    The anaconda deploy interface was saving internal information in
    the node's ``instance_info``, in the user-facing ``stage2`` and
    ``ks_template`` fields. This broke rebuilds using a different image
    with different ``stage2`` or template specified in the image properties.
    This has been fixed by saving the information in the node's
    ``driver_internal_info`` instead.
