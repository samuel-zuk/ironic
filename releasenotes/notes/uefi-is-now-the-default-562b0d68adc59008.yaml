    The default deployment boot mode is *now* UEFI. Legacy BIOS is still
    supported, however operators who require BIOS nodes will need to
    set their nodes, or deployment, appropriately.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default boot mode has been changed and is *now* UEFI. Operators who
    were explicitly relying upon BIOS based deployments in the past,
    may wish to consider setting an explicit node level override for
    the node to only utilize BIOS mode. This can be configured at a
    conductor level with the ``[deploy]default_boot_mode``. Options
    to set this at a node level can be found in the
    `Ironic Installation guide - Advanced features <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/advanced.html#boot-mode-support>`_
    documentation.
