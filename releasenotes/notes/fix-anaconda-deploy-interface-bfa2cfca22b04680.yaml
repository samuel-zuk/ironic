fixes:
  - |
    Fixes a bug in the anaconda deploy interface where the ``ks_options``
    key was not found when rendering the default kickstart template.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where PXEAnacondaDeploy interface's deploy() method did not
    return states.DEPLOYWAIT so the instance went straight to ``active`` instead
    of ``wait call-back``.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where the anaconda deploy interface mistakenly expected
    ``squashfs_id`` instead of ``stage2_id``  property on the image.
  - |
    Fixes the heartbeat mechanism in the default kickstart template
    ks.cfg.template as the heartbeat API only accepts ``POST`` and expects a
    mandatory ``callback_url`` parameter.
  - |
    Fixes handling of tarball images in anaconda deploy interface. Allows user
    specified file extensions to be appended to the disk image symlink. Users
    can now set the file extensions by setting the ``disk_file_extension``
    property on the OS image. This enables users to deploy tarballs with
    anaconda deploy interface.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where automated cleaning was not supported when anaconda
    deploy interface is used.
