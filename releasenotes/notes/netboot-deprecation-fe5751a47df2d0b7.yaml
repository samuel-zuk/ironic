    Booting final instances via network (as opposed to via a local bootloader)
    is now deprecated, except for the cases of booting from volume or the
    ramdisk deploy interface.

    Network boot for whole disk images only works reliable for legacy (BIOS)
    boot. In case of partition images, there is no way to update the kernel,
    which makes this approach insecure.

    Users of partition images must ensure that they either contain the
    ``grub-install`` binary, enough EFI artifacts to boot the operating
    system or a legacy boot partition.
