    Fixes connection caching issues with Redfish BMCs where AccessErrors were
    previously not disqualifying the cached connection from being re-used.
    Ironic will now explicitly open a new connection instead of using the
    previous connection in the cache. Under normal circumstances, the
    ``sushy`` redfish library would detect and refresh sessions,
    however a prior case exists where it may not detect a failure and contain
    cached session credential data which is ultimately invalid, blocking
    future access to the BMC via Redfish until the cache entry expired or
    the ``ironic-conductor`` service was restarted. For more information
    please see `story 2009719 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009719>`_.
