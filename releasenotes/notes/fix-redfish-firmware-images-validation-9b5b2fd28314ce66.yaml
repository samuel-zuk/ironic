    Fixes validation of input argument ``firmware_images`` of ``redfish``
    hardware type clean step ``update_firmware``. Now it validates the argument
    at the beginning of clean step. Prior to this fix issues were determined
    at the time of executing firmware update or not at all (for example,
    mistyping optional field 'wait').
